  <h2><cite>The first rule of frog eating is this: If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first</cite></h2>
  <p>Your <em>frog</em> is your biggest, most important task, and the one you are most likely to procrastinate on. It is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and your results at the moment. </p>
  <h3>Here are the first steps to eating that frog!</h3>
  <h2>Visualize Yourself as You Want to Be</h2>
  <p>Your mental picture of yourself has a powerful effect on your behaviour. Visualize yourself as the person you intend to be in the future. See yourself as the kind of person who gets important jobs done quickly and well on a consistent basis. Your self-image, the way you see yourself on the inside, largely determines your performance on the outside. All improvements in your outer life begin with improvements on the inside. </p>
  <h2>Create Clarity</h2>
  <p>Vagueness, confusion and <q>fuzzy-mindedness</q> are the major culprits for procrastination and lack of motivation. Tracy attests that <em>clarity</em> is the most important concept in personal productivity. The number one reason some people get more work done faster is because they are absolutely clear about their goals and objectives, and they don’t deviate from them. The greater clarity you have regarding what you want and the steps you will have to take to achieve it, the easier it will be for you to overcome procrastination and complete the task before you. </p>
  <h2>Write Your Goal Into Reality</h2>
  <p>Clear written goals have a lot of untapped potential, as they have a wonderful effect on your thinking. They motivate you and galvanize you into action. They stimulate your creativity, release your energy, and help you to overcome procrastination. Goals propel achievement. The bigger your goals and the clearer they are, the more excited you’ll be to achieve them. The more you think about your goals, the greater your inner drive and desire to accomplish them. </p>
