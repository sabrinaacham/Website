  <p><i><q>You can get <strong>control</strong> of your <strong>time</strong> and your <strong>life</strong> only by changing the way you think, work, and deal with the never-ending river of responsibilities that flows over you each day. <strong>I hope that this book changes your life forever</strong>.</i></q> - Tracy. </p>

  <h2><cite>The first rule of frog eating is this: If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first</cite></h2>
  <p>Your <em>frog</em> is your biggest, most important task, and the one you are most likely to procrastinate on. It is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and your results at the moment. </p>
  <h3>Here are the first steps to eating that frog!</h3>
  <h2>Visualize Yourself as You Want to Be</h2>
  <p>Your mental picture of yourself has a powerful effect on your behaviour. Visualize yourself as the person you intend to be in the future. See yourself as the kind of person who gets important jobs done quickly and well on a consistent basis. Your self-image, the way you see yourself on the inside, largely determines your performance on the outside. All improvements in your outer life begin with improvements on the inside. </p>
  <h2>Key point 2</h2>
  <p>Elaborate on the second key point and remember to include a quote or two. </p>
