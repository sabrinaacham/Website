  <p><i><q>You can get <strong>control</strong> of your <strong>time</strong> and your <strong>life</strong> only by changing the way you think, work, and deal with the never-ending river of responsibilities that flows over you each day. <strong>I hope that this book changes your life forever</strong>.</i></q> - Tracy. </p>
  <p><cite>Eat That Frog!</cite> provides the 21 most effective methods for conquering procrastination and accomplishing more.

  <h2><cite>The first rule of frog eating is this: If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first</cite></h2>
  <p>Your <em>frog</em> is your biggest, most important task, and the one you are most likely to procrastinate on. It is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and your results at the moment. </p>
  <h3>Here are the first steps to eating that frog!</h3>
  <h2>Visualize Yourself as You Want to Be</h2>
  <p><img src="images/mirror.jpg" alt="Someone standing in front of a mirror envisioning who they’d like to become" width="100" height="160" align="left" />Your mental picture of yourself has a powerful effect on your behaviour. Visualize yourself as the person you intend to be in the future. See yourself as the kind of person who gets important jobs done quickly and well on a consistent basis. Your self-image, the way you see yourself on the inside, largely determines your performance on the outside. All improvements in your outer life begin with improvements on the inside. </p>
  <p>Your mental picture of yourself has a powerful effect on your behaviour. Visualize yourself as the person you intend to be in the future. See yourself as the kind of person who gets important jobs done quickly and well on a consistent basis. Your self-image, the way you see yourself on the inside, largely determines your performance on the outside. All improvements in your outer life begin with improvements on the inside. </p>
  <h2>Create Clarity</h2>
  <p>Vagueness, confusion and <q>fuzzy-mindedness</q> are the major culprits for procrastination and lack of motivation. Tracy attests that <em>clarity</em> is the most important concept in personal productivity. The number one reason some people get more work done faster is because they are absolutely clear about their goals and objectives, and they don’t deviate from them. The greater clarity you have regarding what you want and the steps you will have to take to achieve it, the easier it will be for you to overcome procrastination and complete the task before you. </p>
  <h2>Write Your Goal Into Reality</h2>
  <p>Clear written goals have a lot of untapped potential, as they have a wonderful effect on your thinking. They motivate you and drive you into action. They stimulate your creativity, release your energy, and help you to overcome procrastination. Goals propel achievement. The bigger your goals and the clearer they are, the more excited you’ll be to achieve them. The more you think about your goals, the greater your inner drive will become and the desire to accomplish them. </p>
  <p><strong>Here is a formula for setting and achieving goals that you can use for the rest of your life. It consists of seven simple steps.</strong> </p>
<ol>

 <li><i>Decide exactly what you want.</i> Decide for yourself, or sit down with your boss to discuss your goals and objectives until you are crystal clear about what is expected of you, and in what order of priority.</li>

 <li><i> Write it down.</i> Think on paper. When you write down a goal, you solidify it and allowing it to take a tangible form. You create something that you can touch and see. On the other hand, a goal or objective that is not in writing is merely a wish or a fantasy, that has no energy behind it. Unwritten goals lead to confusion, vagueness, misdirection, and numerous mistakes.</li>

 <li><i> Set deadlines for your goals, and sub-deadlines if necessary.</i> A goal or decision without a deadline has no urgency. It has no real beginning or end. Without a definite deadline accompanied by the assignment or acceptance of specific responsibilities for completion, you will naturally procrastinate and get very little done.</li>

 <li><i> Make a list of everything that you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal.</i> As you think of new activities, add them to your list. Keep building your list until it is complete. A list gives you a visual picture of the larger task or objective and creates a path to follow. This also significantly increases the likelihood that you will achieve your goal according to schedule.</li>

 <li><i> Organize the list into a plan by priority and sequence.</i>  Decide what you need to do first and what can be done last. Then decide what tasks need to be done in between. Lay out your plan visually in the form of a series of boxes and circles on a sheet of paper, with lines and arrows showing the relationship of each task to each other task. You’ll be amazed at how much easier it is to achieve your goal when you break it down into individual tasks. </li>

 <li><i> Take action immediately.</i> Do something. Do anything. An average plan vigorously executed is far better than a brilliant plan on which nothing is done. For you to achieve any kind of success, execution is everything.</li>

 <li><i> Do something every day that moves you toward your major goal.</i> Build this activity into your daily schedule. Whether it be reading a specific number of pages on a key subject, calling a specific number of prospects or customers, or engaging in a specific period of physical exercise. Whatever it is, you must never miss a day. Once you start moving, keep moving. Don’t stop. This decision and discipline can dramatically increase your speed of goal accomplishment and boost your personal productivity.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Try This Exercise!</h3>
<ul>
<li> Take a clean sheet of paper and make a list
of ten goals you want to accomplish in the next year.
Write your goals as though a year has already passed and
they are now a reality.

<ul>
<li> Use the present tense, positive voice, and first person
so that they are immediately accepted by your subconscious
mind. For example, you could write. “I earn x number
of dollars per year” or “I weigh x number of pounds”
or “I drive such and such a car.” </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Review your list of ten goals and select the one goal
that, if you achieved it, would have the greatest positive
impact on your life. Whatever that goal is, write it on a
separate sheet of paper, set a deadline, make a plan, take
action on your plan, and then do something every single
day that moves you toward that goal. This exercise alone
could change your life!</li>
